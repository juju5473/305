Design of Scientific Studies


*Introduction*

Newton's law of cooling states that the heat loss rate of an object is directly proportional to the
difference in the temperatures between the object and its surroundings (Dill et al., 2010; Greiner et al.,
2012). Meanwhile, increased air flow rate speeds up the evaporation process (Raimundo et al., 2014),
which leads to a dropped temperature (He et al., 2012).
Using statistical modeling, this report compares the effectiveness of four common cooling methods
(stirring, fanning, ice bath and natural evaporation) on three popular hot beverages in Canada -
coffee, milk and tea (Garriguet et al., 2019). The purpose of this report is to share our findings on the
most effective cooling method based on the type of the drink. The target population is all kinds of daily
hot drinks. Our study is significant because people expect a drinkable warm beverage, especially in
winter, but mostly they get a boiling hot one from a cafe. Additionally, this report intends to serve as a
template for describing the experiment setup and statistical analysis methods in the evaluation of
cooling techniques.
